DecentraliSub - Blockchain Subscription Service
Project Title
DecentraliSub - A Decentralized Subscription Management Platform
Project Description
DecentraliSub is a blockchain-based subscription service that enables businesses to offer subscription plans directly on the Ethereum network. Users can subscribe to various plans, renew subscriptions, and manage their memberships entirely through smart contracts, eliminating the need for traditional payment processors and providing complete transparency in subscription management.
The platform operates on a simple yet powerful model where service providers deploy the contract with their subscription plans, and users pay directly in ETH to access services. All subscription data is stored on-chain, making it immutable and verifiable.
Project Vision
Our vision is to revolutionize the subscription economy by:

Eliminating Intermediaries: Direct peer-to-peer subscription payments without payment processors
Global Accessibility: Anyone with an Ethereum wallet can subscribe to services worldwide
Transparency: All subscription data is publicly verifiable on the blockchain
Censorship Resistance: No single entity can block or restrict access to subscriptions
Programmable Subscriptions: Smart contract automation for renewals and access control
Fair Revenue Distribution: 100% of subscription fees go directly to service providers
